Stop and search is a hot topic as of late. Some view it as a neccessary evil to help curb violent crime, while others see it as an inherently predatory and even racist practice. Seeking a deeper understanding of the topic, we aquired multiple datasets spanning from mid 2017 to July 2020, and began to answer what we perceive to be questions of great importance. 

The data was acquired from the offcial UK Police repository at data.police.uk/data.

### 2. How much more frequently are males searched compared to females?

### 3. Which age group undergoes the most searches?

### 4. What is the ethnicity of the citizens who undergo the most searches?

### 5. What is the ethnicity of the officers who perform the most searches? 

### 6. Which piece of legislation do officers most commonly invoke to justify a search? 

### 7. What do officers most commonly claim they are looking for to justify a search?
